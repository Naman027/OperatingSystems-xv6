# Operating Systems Project
## About The Project
> Operating Systems Practical 

<li>Implemented system calls for no of total processes, process info like id, size, count of context switches, SJF scheduling algorithm and tested it for CPU and I/O bound tasks. </li> <li>Resolving page fault via lazy memory allocation.</li>
<li>Incorporated features like creating a kernel process for paging, swap in, swap out mechanisms and writing sanity tests.</li>

## Built With

<li> Xv6 Operating Systems </li>

## Prerequisites
1. System Calls ( obviously abt Operting Systems )
2. Memory Allocation Concept 
3. Virtual Memory Concept
4. Scheduling Algorithms

## Usage
Just Can see the way of implementation.
